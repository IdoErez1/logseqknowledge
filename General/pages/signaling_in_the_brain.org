** Everything we do or think is a result of [[id:414f3e05-bb76-4f1b-83fd-726d0750fe91][neurons]] firing
** About 80% of the brains signaling activity is carried out by glutamate and amma-aminobutyric acid(GABA).
** When glutamate delivers a signal between 2 [[id:414f3e05-bb76-4f1b-83fd-726d0750fe91][neurons]] that haven't spoken before, the connection strengthens.
*** The more they communicate the stronger the connection
*** This is why it is said [[id:414f3e05-bb76-4f1b-83fd-726d0750fe91][neurons]] that fire together wire together
