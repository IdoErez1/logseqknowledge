* Content
** we meet characters in stories that are flawed in some way. this helps us identify emotionally with the character.
** Their mistakes(created by the flaws) and their effort are what drives the story.
** changing yourself and your flaws is hard and you usually aren't aware of them.
** identifying and trying to change requires breaking up the world as you know it and building it up again
** most of the time we will try to resist the change
** the person who succeeds in changing is called the hero
** One way that authors create flaws is create a wrong image of reality and belief for the character
