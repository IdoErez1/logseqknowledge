** According to J.D. Meier there are 7 domains of your life that you spend your time on:
*** Mind
**** This includes things like:
***** Learning
***** Meditation
***** Music
*** Body
*** Emotions
*** Career
*** Finances
*** Relationships
*** Fun
** The idea behind this technique is that once a week you review your list of hot spots and decide if you spent your time on what you wanted to and what to focus on in the week ahead
