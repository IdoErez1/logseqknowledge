** There are several ways to gain control of [[id:33a2b63c-b8c0-4992-82e2-55ed66eb0aab][democratic referees]]
*** Most often it is done by quietly firing civil servants and replacing them with loyal followers
*** Blackmail and bribes can also be used to encorage the civil servants to support the leader
**** Other benefits are also possible for example allowing a certain news source to be an exclusive provider of news in exchange for positive news coverage.
*** Judges who can't be bought can be targeted for impeachment and use the leader's support to remove him from power
*** The most extreme way to capture the referees is to raze the court or institution and create a new one
** if a referee cannot be bought then they can be weakened by other means using power from the referees that can be bought
