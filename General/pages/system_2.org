* Content
** A thinking mode of the brain
** Allocates [[id:98887e13-1be9-49f4-bb68-bb807071e4f3][attention]] to effortful mental activities that demand it
** associated with choice and concentration - you do it willingly and effortfully
** we often think of ourselves and identify ourselves as system 2
** can construct thoughts in an orderly logical manner
** Examples include:
*** brace for a starter gun
*** Gocus attention on the clowns in the circus
*** Focus on the voice of a particular person in crowded and noisy room
*** Look for a woman with white hair
*** Search memory to identify a suprising sound
*** Maintain a faster walking speed than is natural for you 
*** Monitor the appropriateness of your behaviour in a social setting
*** Count the occurences of the letter a in a text page
*** tell someone your phone number
*** fill out a tax form
*** check the validity of a logical argument
** Has some ability to change the way [[id:18f148a4-9204-4e10-8d74-3523b2a7db09][system 1]] works
** Intense focusing on a task can make people blind even to stimuli that normally attract attention
** is normally in low-effort mode
** Activated when an event is detected that violates the model of the world of [[id:18f148a4-9204-4e10-8d74-3523b2a7db09][system 1]].
*** Suprise activates and orients your attention
** most of what you do orginates in [[id:18f148a4-9204-4e10-8d74-3523b2a7db09][system 1]] but whenever things get difficult [[id:13ad7d8c-f771-465a-8e94-235722493bbe][system 2]] takes over.
*** This division of labor works well most of the time since system 2 requires a lot of effort and system 1 is good at what it does and is very efficient, even if inaccurate
