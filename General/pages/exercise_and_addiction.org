** Exercise helps [[id:004b0981-6394-4111-96b6-c253b3481c92][addiction]] by proving a reward for a cue.
** [[id:004b0981-6394-4111-96b6-c253b3481c92][addiction]]exercise whenever you finish [[id:bf8e5885-8392-4003-951b-085af543b17f][physical exercise]] your brain is flooded in all kinds of molecules that make you feel good
** this can be a reward for a new habit
** hence, whenever you get an urge to fall into the [[id:004b0981-6394-4111-96b6-c253b3481c92][addiction]], it can be attempted to do [[id:bf8e5885-8392-4003-951b-085af543b17f][physical exercise]], the logic is that the [[id:8e1fbc6a-882e-4783-8194-c1f304dbb4d0][habit]] will be overwritten
** whenever a urge will strike exercise will replace the addiction
** in addition exercise will release the same chemicals that would probably be released from the [[id:004b0981-6394-4111-96b6-c253b3481c92][addiction]] induced activity, like [[id:7ebb4a36-1c37-473c-a8e7-9f67ec9320ac][dopamine]]
** a 2004 study in london shows that even 10 minutes of exercise could blunt an alcoholic's craving
*** though the bare minimum if you want to root out an [[id:004b0981-6394-4111-96b6-c253b3481c92][addiction]] is 30 minutes 5 days a week
