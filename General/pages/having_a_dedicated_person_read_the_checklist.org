#+title: having a dedicated person read the checklist
#+date: [2022-06-22 Wed 09:15]
* Content
** It is useful in a multi person activity to have a dedicated person who is responsible for checking the items and reading out loud the checklist
** This person should be some whos focus is less important
*** for example a nurse in an operating room or a co-pilot on the plane
** It is important for him to read the list out loud and not just check when something was done in order to increase dialog
