** As we [[id:998bfe87-d5da-4a21-9e33-0596b14ef17e][age]], cells throughout the body lose the ability to adapt to [[id:875c86f3-f4b4-4c08-8f92-4fc8ff11de2c][physiological stress]].
** older cells have a lower threshold for combating the molecular stress of free radicals, excessive energy demands.
** starting at age 40 we lose aproximatly 5% of our overall brain volume per decade, up until age 70, when the process is accelerated
** if your brain isn't actively growing it is dying.
** [[id:bf8e5885-8392-4003-951b-085af543b17f][physical exercise]] is one of the only ways to counter the process of aging because it slows down the natural decline of the [[id:875c86f3-f4b4-4c08-8f92-4fc8ff11de2c][stress]] threshold. 
** In addition, since the aging brain is more vunerable to damage, exercise has a more pronounced effect then on a brain of a younger person.
*** think of a weak person versus a strong person working out. the weaker person will grow faster
** many studies support the evidence that exercise helps against dementia
*** one study people who exercised twice a week were 50% less likely to have dimentia
** TODO exercise effect on the body from other books.
