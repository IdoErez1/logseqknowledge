** [[id:bf8e5885-8392-4003-951b-085af543b17f][physical exercise]] has been shown to help [[id:7e0c6768-32db-4385-b319-753e21b12d1d][anxiety]] as much as medication like prozac
*** multiple studies show this. the group that exercised most are always the least anxious at the end of the study
** the theory is when we increase our heart rate and breathing in the context of exercise, we learn that physical signs don't necessarily lead to [[id:7e0c6768-32db-4385-b319-753e21b12d1d][anxiety]] attacks.
** thus interupts the [[id:7e0c6768-32db-4385-b319-753e21b12d1d][anxiety]] feedback loop to [[id:6753d3de-3cd6-4851-88fd-a22e0f9273dc][the brain]]
** in addition exercise boosts [[id:2c9d39ae-aa8e-466c-9704-c963f2bb1c92][serotonin]] levels, which calms us down and enhances our feelings of security
** also triggers the release of GABA(gammaamino-butyric acid), a major inhibitory [[id:7a5dfa2e-5784-4d03-aae5-d5fb5d6cd438][neurotransmitter]] that is a main target for anti-[[id:7e0c6768-32db-4385-b319-753e21b12d1d][anxiety]] medication
