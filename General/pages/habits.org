** Habbits are things you're brain automaticlly does when presented with a cue
** habbits do not require mental resources since your brain does them automaticly
** habits are made up of 3 stages:
*** the cue - something that invokes the habit. can be a time of day, place, feeling, presence of other people or previous behaviour
*** the action - the action itself that is triggerd by the cue
*** the reward - this gives the brain the reason to strengthem the habit. needs to be something neurological like a feeling of satisfaction or acomplishment
** the easiest way to try and prevent distractions is to try to prevent the cue from triggering
