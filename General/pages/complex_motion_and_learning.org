** complex motion can expand and strengthen neural networks
** the more complex the movement the more complex the connections will be
** they can be recruited by other areas of [[id:6753d3de-3cd6-4851-88fd-a22e0f9273dc][the brain]] and used for thinking
** this is why learning piano can help a kid be better at math
** caused because of the strong connection between [[id:eccbaae0-ce4e-4d02-b7ed-68fbf47cbb3e][cerebellum]] and learning
