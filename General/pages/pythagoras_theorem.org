** Geometric therorem
** States that in a right angle triangle the square made out of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the area of the squares made from the two other sides

*** The area in these two diagrams are the same since they have the same side length
*** The triangles are congruent according to Side - Angle - Side
*** therefore if we subtract the area of the entire square minus the 4 triangles from both diagrams we get that the big square is equal to the sum of the two smaller ones
*** the big square is a square since all 4 sides are equal and there is a right degree angle via angle subtraction
