** Citizens are more likely to support authoritarian measures during times of crisis and emergency
** Leaders often use the excuse of a crisis that it is necessary to do something undemocratic in order to "save democracy"
** many times leaders create the crisis in order to have an excuse to use authoritarian measures. This also allows leaders to act and do things they wouldn't have been able to do with public support normally, like joining a war or to have citizens give up civil liberties
