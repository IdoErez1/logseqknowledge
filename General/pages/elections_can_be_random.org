** Elections can be random and unpredictable, so that even someone radical can be chosen. This is true for a number of reasons:
*** Polarization: The more polarized a country is the less there are "free voters" and the more radical voters there are. That means that someone might prefer to vote for someone with a radical and dangerous opinions that can harm the citizens and democracy because they prefer this over the alternitive of voting for someone with the different opinion.
*** Elections are largely based on recent events. recent events before elections are largely random but can often times be planned by the dangerous demagogue so that it will give him more votes
