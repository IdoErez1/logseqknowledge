** The "referees" in democracy are supposed to be the people who are fair and just and make sure the democratic rules of the game are being followed
*** Examples of referees:
**** Justice system
**** Law enforcement
**** Taxation
**** Intellegence
**** Free press
**** and any other regulatory institute
** [[id:ab581e0c-3d9b-44b2-8df2-61f559f6b830][Controlling the democratic referees]] can yield great benefit for the autocrat
*** Examples:
**** if judician and law enforcement remain independent then they might expose and punish the misconduct of the leader while if on the leaders side they could prevent an investigation.
**** Allow the autocrat to punish and expose his opposition, selective enforcement of the law
**** Intelligence agencies can be used to spy on critics and dig up material for blackmail
*** By controlling the referees the leaders can develop a decisive advantage over their opponents
*** These processess are slow and appear to happen according to the law therefor citizen don't really notice that they are losing their democracy
