* Content
** Written by Ronald Knox in 1924
*** 1. The criminal must be mentioned somewhere in the early part of the story. but his thoughts were not revealed to the reader at any point
*** 2. All supernatural agencies are ruled out - it is something natural
*** 3. No more than one secret room or passage
*** 4. No using undiscovered poisons or anything that will need a long scientific explaination at the end(for example a poison that will kill you the moment you find someone is the criminal)
*** 5. No Chinese people must be featured in the story - No racial cliches
*** 6. No Accidents must ever help a detective, nor must he have an anaccountable intution which proves to be right
*** 7. The detective must not be the one who commited the crime
*** 8. The detective must declare any clues that he finds
*** 9. The "sidekick" of the detective must not conceal from the reader any thoughts he has: his intelligence must be only very slightly lower than that of the reader
*** 10. Twin brothers and doubles in general must not appear unless we have been prepared for them.
