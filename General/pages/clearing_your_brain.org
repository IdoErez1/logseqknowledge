** The human brain is not good at holding large amounts of information
*** It wastes resources and can damage focus and concentration
*** Uses working memory
** it is useful to release the brain from the burden of the information by writing it down
** [[id:9880bf54-c797-47f2-8188-81af375fff00][zeigarnik effect]]
** when you write things down it no longer needs to use your working memory
** you should carry a notebook everywhere and write many lists
** lists examples:
*** shopping list
*** task list
*** meetings list
*** schedual & calender
*** worry list - when you feel like you are losing control because of your worries you can empty them on paper
*** waiting list - everything you are waiting for - packages that are supposed to arrive, money someone owns you, an email you are waiting for a response on.
*** etc.
** One should not create too many lists since that too damages productivity - you will be occupied with list making you will work less.
