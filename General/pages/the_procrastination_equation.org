** \[ Motivation = \frac{Expectancy\times Value}{Impulsiveness\times Delay} $ \]
*** Motivation - the opposite of procrastination 
*** Expectancy - do you expect you will be able to reach your goal. If you don't believe you can do it it will harm your motivation
*** Value - How valuable is the thing you are pursing for you. The more valuable it is the more motivation you will have
*** Impulsiveness - How often do you purse immediate gratification? how distractable are you? If you are impulsive you will have less motivation
*** Delay - How far delayed into the future is your goal. if it is very far in the future then you will have less motivation
