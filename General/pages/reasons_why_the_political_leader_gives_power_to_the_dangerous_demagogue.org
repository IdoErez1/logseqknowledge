** There are 2 main reasons why the political democratic leader gives power to the potential anti-democratic demagogue:
*** The belief that the political leader with all his support and all the unrest he creates can be contained if the leader is closer to the leader and given power
*** When there is enough ideological simularites that the leader prefers to nominate the demagogue over the more democratic candidate with opposing ideology
