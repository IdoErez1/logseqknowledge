** [[id:875c86f3-f4b4-4c08-8f92-4fc8ff11de2c][physiological stress]] responses varies from mild to severe
** severe stress responses activate [[id:6753d3de-3cd6-4851-88fd-a22e0f9273dc][the brain's]] [[id:b8d8f7b5-2f7f-40ff-af7d-25b0b533f391][fight or flight response]]
** This is a complex physiological response that activates both body and brain
** The brain needs to engrave a memory of what happend so it will not happend again
** This response calls into action several of [[id:6753d3de-3cd6-4851-88fd-a22e0f9273dc][the brain]]'s most powerful [[id:44082111-5bb9-471b-9ba6-5111fe0d5821][hormones]] and [[id:7a5dfa2e-5784-4d03-aae5-d5fb5d6cd438][neurotransmitters]]
** It starts when the senses detect a strong emotional response.
** This does not have to be fear, it can also be any intense emotional response, even sexual arousal
** This triggers the [[id:6b5a8794-ebee-4041-a196-9133cff0f800][amygdala]], which then engraves it to memory to help in the future
** The amygdala can get the sensory data throught the [[id:124a74df-4a31-4171-b46d-549b7a505162][prefrontal cortex]] however there is an alternative route where it gets the data directly without going through the prefrontal cortex for an interpretation beforehand
** as soon as the signal is recieves, the [[id:6b5a8794-ebee-4041-a196-9133cff0f800][amygdala]] fires the alarm - releasing various [[id:44082111-5bb9-471b-9ba6-5111fe0d5821][hormones]] and [[id:7a5dfa2e-5784-4d03-aae5-d5fb5d6cd438][neurotransmitters]]:
*** first [[id:eecce8cc-1fd2-48f2-9f72-f71bd01764b5][norepinephrine]] is released and activates the adrenal gland to dump the [[id:44082111-5bb9-471b-9ba6-5111fe0d5821][hormones]] empinephrine and [[id:eecce8cc-1fd2-48f2-9f72-f71bd01764b5][adrenalin]] into the blood stream
*** this causes heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing to increase
*** at the same time, [[id:eecce8cc-1fd2-48f2-9f72-f71bd01764b5][norepinephrine]] travels to the hypothalmus, which prompt the pituitary gland to release [[id:346270b0-9cf6-4377-84b8-a42c611165c2][cortisol]]
