* Content
** Nerve cells
** Most have one long skinny extention called an axon on one end
*** The axon sends information to another neuron or muscle cell
** The other end has a tree of shorter barbs called dendrites that recieve signals from axons
** when we see, taste or touch it is nerve cells that relay the information to [[id:6753d3de-3cd6-4851-88fd-a22e0f9273dc][the brain]]
** the nerve cells are coated by something called myelin, that keeps charged ions out of the cells
*** there are however small breaks, or channals in the myelin that allow ions to enter.  
*** these ion channals are used to increase speed and efficiency of neural connections.
*** there are also junctions called synapses that are used by [[id:7a5dfa2e-5784-4d03-aae5-d5fb5d6cd438][neurotransmitters]] like [[id:7ebb4a36-1c37-473c-a8e7-9f67ec9320ac][dopamine]] and [[id:2c9d39ae-aa8e-466c-9704-c963f2bb1c92][serotonin]] to communicate to adjacent cells
