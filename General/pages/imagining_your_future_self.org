** A person is usually very disconnected from his future self. He thinks of him as practically a stranger 
** The more disconnected you are for your future self the more you are likely to [[id:778e7de2-6196-4aee-b597-c84e17f68d49][procrastinate]] or make decisions that don't regard the future
** If you are more connected to your future self you are more likely to make decisions like:
*** Saving for retirement
*** doing things now instead of delaying them for tomorrow
*** give your future self more tasks
** Writing a letter to your future self or seeing a virtual image can help you feel more connected to him.
