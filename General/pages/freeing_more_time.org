** according to [[id:133dcb36-c250-4baa-8da0-a06477480061][Parkingson's Law]] the best way to free more time is to set deadlines
** another way to freeing more time is to stop multitasking
*** People can't really multitask, multitasking is just switching between tasks fast enough so that it feels like you are doing two things at once.
*** when you multitask you pay a mental energy cost whenever you switch a task
**** you have pull from your mind all the information related to the other task and put away all the information related to the current task.
