* Content
** There are four general ways parties and leaders can help defend democracy from authoritarian leaders:
*** deny them the ability to participate in elections by failing to nominate them
**** This will probably come at a price of additional votes that will be lost
*** Purge the radicals from the political party
*** Refuse to co-operate with or join another political radical anti-democratic party
**** Often times moderate parties will join up with a radical party in order to secure a majority. This can have drastic consiquences as seen with germany and italy
*** Isolate the radical leaders/parties politically
